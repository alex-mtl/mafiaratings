<p>Ten (10) people participate in each game. The Moderator observes the game and orchestrates its progress.</p>

<p>The Players are divided into two groups: Red and Dark. The Red Players are law-abiding citizens (they draw the &laquo;Citizen&raquo; card); the Dark Players are Mafiosi (they draw the &laquo;Mafia&raquo; card). Seven (7) red cards and three (3) dark cards are played. One of the seven red cards is different from the others - the &laquo;Sheriff&raquo; card. This Player becomes the leader of the Red Players. The Dark players also have a leader, the one who draws the &laquo;Don&raquo; card. </p>

<p>The game has two parts: day and night. During the game, the Dark Players must destroy the Red Players and vice versa.</p>

<p>The ten players sit around the playing table. Everyone puts on blindfolds, because at night all the Players' eyes must be closed. After this, an assistant offers a card to each of the players, who draw it with their eyes closed. After all the Players have drawn cards and know which group they are in, the assistant collects the cards and the game begins.</p>

<p>The Moderator announces: &laquo;It is night.&raquo; Players, with blindfolds on, bow their heads to ensure that the movements of their neighbors and shadow play don't become a source of additional information for them. </p>

<p>The Moderator announces: &laquo;The Mafia is awake.&raquo; Players who received dark cards, including the Don, take off their blindfolds and get to know each other. This is the first and only night when all the Mafia players open their eyes together. It is granted them so that they can determine an order for eliminating the Red Players. This needs to be done silently, so that the nearby Red Players do not feel the movements around them. </p>

<p>The Moderator announces: &laquo;The Mafia is falling asleep.&raquo; Following these words, the Dark Players put on their blindfolds.</p>

<p>The Moderator's next words: &laquo;The Don is awake.&raquo; The Don opens his eyes. During this night the Moderator gets to know the Don. On subsequent nights, the Don will wake up in order to find the Sheriff. </p>

<p>The Moderator says: &laquo;The Don is falling asleep.&raquo; The Don puts on his blindfold.<br>
The Moderator says: &laquo;The Sheriff is awake.&raquo; The Sheriff takes of his blindfold and gets to know the Moderator. On subsequent nights, the Sheriff will have the chance to wake up and look for the Dark Players.<br>
The Moderator says: &laquo;The Sheriff is falling asleep.&raquo;<br></p>

<p>&laquo;Good morning! Everyone is awake.&raquo;</p>

<p>The first day. All the Players take off their blindfolds. During the day, discussions take place. Each Player has one minute to state his ideas, thoughts and suspicions. The goal of the first round, and the game as a whole, is for Red Players to find the Dark Players and eliminate them from the game. Naturally, the opposite is true for the Dark Players. The Dark Players have an advantage because they know who's who, i.e. who the other Dark Players are in the game. The Player designated number 1 begins the discussion period which then proceeds in a circle around the table. During the daytime discussion, Players can nominate one other Player for elimination from the game. At the end of the discussion there is a vote. The Player who receives the most votes is eliminated from the game.</p>

<p>If during the first daytime round only one person is nominated for elimination, there is no vote. During every other daytime round a vote takes place regardless of the amount of nominations. The eliminated Player has the right to present a final statement (up to one minute in length).  </p>

<img src="images/10.jpg" align="left" width="250" class="in-text">
<p>If two or more Players receive the same amount of votes for elimination, the situation is called a &laquo;Car Crash&raquo;. In this case, each of these Players has the chance to plead his case for a maximum of 30 seconds - to convince the other Players of his &laquo;Redness&raquo;, make excuses, and otherwise attempt to remain in the game. After this process there is a revote. If one Player receives the most votes, he is eliminated. If the nominated Players once again receive the same amount of votes, a question is put forward for the voters: &laquo;Who is in favor of elimination of all the nominated players?&raquo; If the majority of the votes are in support, the Players are eliminated; if the majority is against, they remain in the game. If the vote is split 50/50, the nominated Players remain in the game.</p>

<p>After the first round again comes nighttime. During this and the following nights, the Mafia have the chance to &laquo;shoot&raquo;. &laquo;Shooting&raquo; proceeds in the following manner: the Mafiosi, who have agreed on an order for eliminating the Red Players, &laquo;shoot&raquo; (with blindfolds on). The Moderator, who announces &laquo;The Mafia is on the hunt&raquo;, names the numbers of the players in turn, and if all the members of the Mafia &laquo;shoot&raquo; simultaneously at a particular number, the Moderator notes that the player has been &laquo;shot&raquo;. If one of the Mafia &laquo;shoots&raquo; at a different number or doesn't &laquo;shoot&raquo; at all, the Moderator notes a &laquo;miss&raquo;. Players &laquo;shoot&raquo; by using a shotgun hand gesture.</p>

<p>The Moderator announces: &laquo;The Mafia are retreating.&raquo; He then announces, &laquo;The Don is awake.&raquo; The Don opens his eyes and attempts to find the Sherriff. He shows the Moderator (via a hand gesture) a number under which he thinks the Sheriff is hiding. The Moderator either nods if the guess is correct or shakes his head if it is not. The Don falls asleep and the Sheriff wakes up. The Sheriff has similar privileges for nighttime checks. He is looking for the Dark Players. After he receives an answer from the Moderator, the Sheriff falls asleep, and the Moderator announces the beginning of the second day.</p>

<p>If the Mafia has struck down a player during the night, the Moderator announces this and allows the &laquo;shot&raquo; Player a final statement. If the Mafia &laquo;missed&raquo;, the Moderator announces that it really is a good morning - that there were no nighttime casualties. On the second day, the discussion period begins with the person next to the Player that spoke first on the first day. During this round and all the subsequent rounds, the procedures of the game do not change. Nights and days cycle with the victories for one or the other team. </p>

<p>The game ends in favor of the Red Players in the case that all Dark Players have been eliminated. The Dark Players win if there remains an equal amount of Red and Dark Players. </p>
