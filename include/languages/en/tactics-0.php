<p>Almost everything in the game depends on the behavior of the Sheriff. He is the only Red Player who has at least some concrete knowledge. He is responsible for providing the other Red Players with this knowledge, but at exactly the right moment - not too soon and not too late. A Player who understands when this moment arrives essentially understands the game.</p>

<img src="images/4.jpg" align="left" width="250" class="in-text">
<p>How does one determine this moment? It occurs during the so-called &laquo;critical round&raquo;. A critical round is a day when the Red Players must either eliminate the Mafiosi or lose the game. For example, if there are 7 Players left at the table, out of whom 3 are Dark. If during this day a Red Player is killed, the game is lost. Therefore the Sheriff must admit to being the Sheriff and disclose the results of his checks. This will help the Red Players make the correct decision about the elimination. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Dark Players know about this as well, and commonly one of them announces himself as Sheriff. It is the task of the Red Players to determine which Sheriff is the real one.</p>
<p>A Sheriff must not leave the table without announcing that he is the Sheriff and disclosing the results of his checks, even if he was killed during the night. Otherwise one of the Mafiosi will name themselves as the Sheriff, will obtain the full trust of the Red Players, and the game can be considered lost. </p>

<p>Here is an example of a correctly played game for the Sheriff:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sheriff's Player Number is 4. The Mafia is playing under numbers 2, 7, and 9.</li>
<li>During the first night, the Mafia kill player 1.</li>
<li>The Sheriff checks player 3. He turns out to be a Red Player.</li>
<li>During the day, Player 8 is killed. The Sheriff doesn't know for sure whether he is a Dark or Red Player, and thus must assume the worst - that he is Red.</li>
<li>On the second night, the Mafia kill Player 5. </li>
<li>The Sheriff checks player 7. He turns out to be a Dark Player.</li>
<li>Morning comes. There are 7 Players remaining - 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10. Players 1, 5, and 8 have been killed. The Sheriff can say with certainty that Players 1 and 5 (killed during the night) are Red Players. Nothing is known for certain about Player 8, so the Sheriff assumes that he is Red. Thus there are 7 Players at the table and 3 of them are Dark. This is the critical round. If a Red Player is killed now, the Sheriff's team loses.</li>
<li>When it is the Sheriff's turn to speak, he announces that he is the Sheriff, that Player 3 is Red and Player 7 is Dark. To continue the game, the Reds must eliminate Player 7.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is another example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Sheriff is playing as number 1. The Mafia is playing as numbers 3, 5 and 10. </li>
<li>During the first night, the Mafia kill player 4.</li>
<li>The Sheriff checks player 5.  He is a Dark Player.</li>
<li>During the day, Player 5 is killed.</li>
<li>On the second night, the Mafia kill player 7. </li>
<li>The Sheriff checks player 9. He turns out to be a Red Player.</li>
<li>Morning comes. There are 7 Players remaining - 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9, and 10. But the Sheriff knows for certain that eliminated Player 5 was a Dark Player. So there are seven players and two Mafiosi. This is not the critical round - if a Red Player is killed, the game will continue. Should the Sheriff disclose who he is? Of course not.</li>

<li>During the day, Player 9 is killed.</li>
<li>The Sheriff checks player 3.  He is a Dark Player.</li>
<li>Morning comes. There are 5 players remaining - 1, 2, 3, 8, and 10. The Sheriff doesn't know whether Player 6 is Red or Dark, so he must assume there are two Dark Players remaining. This is the critical round.</li>
<li>When it is the Sheriff's turn to speak, he announces that he is the Sheriff and discloses the results of his checks. Now 
the Red Players know that Players 3 and 5 are Mafiosi. They only need to find number 10. Their chances of winning are very high. </li>
</ul>


<p>If the Sheriff does a nighttime check and a player turns out to be Red, the Sheriff often gives him some sign or signal of confidence. Of course, he does this in a way that cannot be seen by anyone else. This allows them to cooperate. Often this player will announce himself as the Sheriff and tell the others about the results of the Sheriff's checks as though they are his own. Then the Mafia tries to kill the fake Sheriff at night. This is very beneficial to the 	Red Players, because the real Sheriff remains in the game and continues his checks.</p>
